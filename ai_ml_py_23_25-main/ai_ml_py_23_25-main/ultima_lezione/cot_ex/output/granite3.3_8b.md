# **FEW SHOT**

Step 1: Calculate the depreciation for one year: 15% of $20,000 = 0.15 × $20,000 = $3,000
Step 2: Determine the value after one year: $20,000 - $3,000 = $17,000
Step 3: Repeat the process for the second and third years:
   - Second year depreciation: 15% of $17,000 = $2,550
     Value after second year: $17,000 - $2,550 = $14,450
   - Third year depreciation: 15% of $14,450 ≈ $2,167.50
     Value after third year: $14,450 - $2,167.50 ≈ $12,282.50

Answer: The car will be worth approximately $12,282.50 in 3 years.

# **SELF CONSISTENCY**

### Approach 1: Using Venn Diagrams

1. **Visualize the Problem**: 
   - Draw two overlapping circles representing "Pizza" (P) and "Burgers" (B).
   - The intersection represents students who like both pizza and burgers (6 students).

2. **Label Known Values**:
   - Let `|P|` be the number of students who like pizza: 18.
   - Let `|B|` be the number of students who like burgers: 12.
   - Intersection `|P ∩ B|`: 6 (both like pizza and burgers).

3. **Find Non-Overlapping Sectors**:
   - Students who only like pizza (`|P| - |P ∩ B|`): \(18 - 6 = 12\).
   - Students who only like burgers (`|B| - |P ∩ B|`): \(12 - 6 = 6\).

4. **Calculate Total Liking Either or Both**:
   - Sum of students liking either pizza, burgers, or both:
     \[
     |P| + |B| - |P ∩ B| = 18 + 12 - 6 = 24
     \]

5. **Determine Students Who Like Neither**:
   - Total class size is 30. Therefore, students liking neither:
     \[
     30 - 24 = 6
     \]

### Approach 2: Using Set Theory Formulas

1. **Identify Given Sets and Intersection**:
   - Let \( P \) be the set of students who like pizza (\(|P| = 18\)).
   - Let \( B \) be the set of students who like burgers (\(|B| = 12\)).
   - Intersection \(|P \cap B| = 6\).

2. **Apply Set Theory Formula**:
   - Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find those liking either or both:
     \[
     |P \cup B| = |P| + |B| - |P \cap B| = 18 + 12 - 6 = 24
     \]

3. **Calculate Students Liking Neither**:
   - Total students in the class is 30, so:
     \[
     30 - |P \cup B| = 30 - 24 = 6
     \]

### Approach 3: Using Logical Reasoning

1. **Total Count Logic**:
   - Total students = 30.
   - Students who like at least one (either pizza or burgers or both):
     \[
     |P \cup B| = 24 \text{ (as calculated via other approaches)}
     \]

2. **Determine Students Liking Neither**:
   - Simply subtract those counted in `|P ∪ B|` from the total:
     \[
     30 - 24 = 6
     \]

### Conclusion

All three approaches confirm that 6 students like neither pizza nor burgers. 

- **Venn Diagram**: Visualizes intersections and non-overlapping regions.
- **Set Theory Formulas**: Uses mathematical principles to calculate the union.
- **Logical Reasoning**: Directly applies total count and subtraction for those liking either or both.

Thus, the number of students who like neither pizza nor burgers is \(\boxed{6}\).

# **CHAIN OF VERIFICATION**

Step 1: Initial answer
The capital of Australia is Canberra.

Step 2: Verification
- Canberra is not the largest city in Australia; Sydney and Melbourne have larger populations. However, being a capital often doesn't require it to be the most populous city.
- The seat of the Australian government is indeed located in Canberra. It was purposely designed as a capital city and is home to significant government institutions like Parliament House, the High Court of Australia, and numerous federal departments.
- There might be confusion with other major Australian cities such as Sydney (New South Wales' capital) or Melbourne (Victoria's capital), but neither is the national capital of Australia.

Step 3: Final verified answer with explanation
The capital of Australia is Canberra. Established in 1913 as a planned city to serve as the seat of the federal government, Canberra houses key government buildings and institutions, distinguishing it from other major Australian cities like Sydney and Melbourne which are state capitals rather than national. Although not the most populous city in the country, its role as the administrative center is undeniable.

# **MULTI STEP REASONING**

Step 1: We know the final revenue after all changes is $1,265,000, and we need to find the initial revenue before any changes occurred.

Step 2: To set up the equation with the revenue changes, let's denote the initial revenue as R.

- After a 25% increase in Year 1, the revenue becomes R * 1.25.
- In Year 2, it decreased by 10%, so the revenue is (R * 1.25) * 0.9 = R * 1.125.
- In Year 3, it increased by 15%, resulting in (R * 1.125) * 1.15 = R * 1.265.

Step 3: Working backwards from the final amount:
Given that the final revenue is $1,265,000, we can set up the equation as follows:

R * 1.265 = 1,265,000

To find R (initial revenue), divide both sides by 1.265:

R = 1,265,000 / 1.265 ≈ 1,000,000

Step 4: Verification by working forwards:
Let's check our answer by applying the yearly changes to the initial revenue of $1,000,000:

- Year 1 (25% increase): 1,000,000 * 1.25 = 1,250,000
- Year 2 (10% decrease): 1,250,000 * 0.9 = 1,125,000
- Year 3 (15% increase): 1,125,000 * 1.15 ≈ 1,265,000

The calculated final revenue matches the given amount in the problem statement, confirming that our initial revenue calculation was correct. 

Therefore, the initial revenue was approximately $1,000,000.
