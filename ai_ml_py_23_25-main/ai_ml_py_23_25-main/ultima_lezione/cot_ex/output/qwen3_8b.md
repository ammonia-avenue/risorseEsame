<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much the car will be worth in 3 years if it depreciates 15% each year. The current value is $20,000. Let me think through this step by step.

First, depreciation means the car loses value each year. A 15% depreciation each year means that each year the car is worth 85% of its previous year's value. Because if you take away 15%, you're left with 100% - 15% = 85%. So, each year, the value is multiplied by 0.85.

So, starting with $20,000, after the first year, the value would be 20,000 * 0.85. Then, after the second year, that amount would be multiplied by 0.85 again, and then the third year as well. So, it's like applying the 15% depreciation three times.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for exponential decay: Final Value = Initial Value * (1 - rate)^time. In this case, the rate is 15% or 0.15, and the time is 3 years. So plugging in the numbers: Final Value = 20,000 * (1 - 0.15)^3 = 20,000 * (0.85)^3.

Let me calculate that. First, compute 0.85 cubed. 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225. Then, 0.7225 * 0.85. Let me do that multiplication. 0.7225 * 0.85. Hmm, 0.7225 * 0.8 = 0.578, and 0.7225 * 0.05 = 0.036125. Adding those together: 0.578 + 0.036125 = 0.614125. So, 0.85^3 is 0.614125.

Now, multiply that by 20,000. 20,000 * 0.614125. Let me compute that. 20,000 * 0.6 = 12,000. 20,000 * 0.014125 = 20,000 * 0.01 + 20,000 * 0.004125. Wait, maybe it's easier to do 0.614125 * 20,000 directly.

Alternatively, 0.614125 * 20,000 = 0.614125 * 2 * 10,000 = 1.22825 * 10,000 = 12,282.5. So, the final value after 3 years would be $12,282.50.

Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me verify the calculation step by step.

First, 0.85^3:

First, 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225. That's correct.

Then, 0.7225 * 0.85. Let me compute this more carefully.

Multiplying 0.7225 by 0.85:

Break down 0.85 into 0.8 + 0.05.

So, 0.7225 * 0.8 = 0.578

0.7225 * 0.05 = 0.036125

Adding them together: 0.578 + 0.036125 = 0.614125. Yes, that's correct.

So, 0.614125 * 20,000.

Let me compute 20,000 * 0.614125.

Well, 20,000 * 0.6 = 12,000

20,000 * 0.014125 = ?

Compute 20,000 * 0.01 = 200

20,000 * 0.004 = 80

20,000 * 0.000125 = 2.5

So, 200 + 80 + 2.5 = 282.5

So total is 12,000 + 282.5 = 12,282.5. Therefore, $12,282.50.

So, the car will be worth $12,282.50 after 3 years. Let me check if there's another way to compute it step by step, just to confirm.

First year: 20,000 * 0.15 = 3,000 depreciation. So value is 20,000 - 3,000 = 17,000.

Second year: 17,000 * 0.15 = 2,550 depreciation. New value: 17,000 - 2,550 = 14,450.

Third year: 14,450 * 0.15 = 2,167.50 depreciation. New value: 14,450 - 2,167.50 = 12,282.50.

Yes, that matches. So both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is $12,282.50. Since currency is usually rounded to two decimal places, that's $12,282.50.

I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. The step-by-step depreciation gives the same result as the formula. So, I'm confident that's the right value.
</think>

To determine the car's value after 3 years of 15% annual depreciation, we use the concept of exponential decay. Each year, the car's value is reduced by 15%, which means it retains 85% (or 0.85) of its previous year's value.

### **Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Initial Value:**  
   $20,000

2. **Annual Depreciation Rate:**  
   15% → 0.15

3. **Retained Value Factor Each Year:**  
   $1 - 0.15 = 0.85$

4. **Formula for Final Value After 3 Years:**  
   $$
   \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (0.85)^3
   $$

5. **Compute the Depreciation Factor:**  
   $$
   0.85^3 = 0.85 \times 0.85 \times 0.85 = 0.614125
   $$

6. **Apply the Factor to Initial Value:**  
   $$
   20,000 \times 0.614125 = 12,282.50
   $$

---

### **Verification via Step-by-Step Depreciation:**

- **Year 1:**  
  Depreciation: $20,000 \times 0.15 = 3,000$  
  New Value: $20,000 - 3,000 = 17,000$

- **Year 2:**  
  Depreciation: $17,000 \times 0.15 = 2,550$  
  New Value: $17,000 - 2,550 = 14,450$

- **Year 3:**  
  Depreciation: $14,450 \times 0.15 = 2,167.50$  
  New Value: $14,450 - 2,167.50 = 12,282.50$

---

### **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{12,282.50}
$$

The car will be worth **$12,282.50** after 3 years.

# **SELF CONSISTENCY**

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many students in a class of 30 like neither pizza nor burgers. The given information is that 18 like pizza, 12 like burgers, and 6 like both. Let me try to approach this problem using three different methods: Venn diagrams, set theory formulas, and logical reasoning. I should check if all approaches give the same answer to confirm my solution.

Starting with Approach 1: Using Venn diagrams. Alright, Venn diagrams are a visual way to represent sets. Let me imagine two overlapping circles: one for pizza lovers and one for burger lovers. The overlapping area represents students who like both pizza and burgers. 

First, the total number of students who like pizza is 18. But 6 of those also like burgers. So, the number of students who like only pizza would be 18 minus 6, which is 12. Similarly, for burgers, there are 12 students who like burgers, but 6 of them also like pizza. So, the number of students who like only burgers is 12 minus 6, which is 6. 

Now, if I add up the students who like only pizza (12), only burgers (6), and both (6), that gives 12 + 6 + 6 = 24 students. Since the total class is 30, the number of students who like neither would be 30 minus 24, which is 6. Wait, so according to this, the answer is 6? Let me check again. 

Wait, hold on. If only pizza is 12, only burgers is 6, and both is 6, then total is 12 + 6 + 6 = 24. Subtracting from 30 gives 6. That seems right. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the numbers. 

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the union of pizza and burgers. The formula for the union is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. So, substituting the numbers, that would be 18 + 12 - 6 = 24. Therefore, 24 students like either pizza or burgers or both. Hence, the remaining students who like neither is 30 - 24 = 6. Okay, so that seems consistent with the Venn diagram approach. 

Moving on to Approach 2: Using set theory formulas. This is essentially the same as the first approach, but let me formalize it. 

The formula for the number of elements in the union of two sets is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. So here, A is the set of students who like pizza, and B is the set who like burgers. 

Given |A| = 18, |B| = 12, and |A ∩ B| = 6. 

So |A ∪ B| = 18 + 12 - 6 = 24. 

Therefore, the number of students who like neither is the total number of students minus the number in the union: 30 - 24 = 6. 

Same answer as before. So that's good. 

Approach 3: Using logical reasoning. Let's think about this step by step without formulas. 

First, we know that 18 students like pizza. But some of them also like burgers. Specifically, 6 students like both. So, if I take the 18 pizza lovers and subtract the 6 who also like burgers, I get 12 students who only like pizza. 

Similarly, for the 12 students who like burgers, 6 of them also like pizza. So, subtracting those 6 from the 12 gives 6 students who only like burgers. 

Now, adding up the students who like only pizza (12), only burgers (6), and both (6) gives 12 + 6 + 6 = 24. 

Therefore, the number of students who don't like either is 30 - 24 = 6. 

Hmm, same result again. So all three approaches give me 6. That seems to confirm that the answer is 6. 

Wait, but let me double-check if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem states that 6 like both. So, is that the intersection? Yes. So the formula is correct. 

Another way to think about it: if there are 6 who like both, then the total number of students who like at least one is 18 + 12 - 6 = 24. So 30 - 24 = 6. 

Alternatively, if I consider that the number of students who like only pizza is 18 - 6 = 12, only burgers is 12 - 6 = 6, and both is 6. So total is 12 + 6 + 6 = 24. 

Yes, that's the same as before. 

Is there a possibility that the 6 who like both are counted in both the pizza and burger groups? Yes, that's why we subtract them once when calculating the union. 

Alternatively, if someone thought that the 6 who like both are already included in the counts of pizza and burgers, then the total number of students who like either is 18 + 12 - 6 = 24. So again, same result. 

Therefore, all three approaches lead me to the conclusion that 6 students like neither pizza nor burgers. 

But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way someone might approach this problem and perhaps get a different answer. For example, suppose someone thought that the 6 who like both are not subtracted, so they would think 18 + 12 = 30, which would imply that all students like at least one, but that's not possible because the total class is 30, but that would mean 0 like neither. But that's wrong because the overlap is subtracted. 

Alternatively, someone might miscalculate the number of students who like only pizza or only burgers. For instance, if they thought that the number of students who like only pizza is 18 and only burgers is 12, then adding them would be 18 + 12 = 30, but that doesn't account for the overlap. But since they are overlapping, you have to subtract the overlap once. 

But since in all approaches I've considered, the answer is 6, and the calculations check out, I think the answer is correct. 

Therefore, using all three methods, the number of students who like neither pizza nor burgers is 6.

**Final Answer**
The number of students who like neither pizza nor burgers is \boxed{6}.
</think>

To determine how many students like **neither** pizza nor burgers, we are given:

- Total number of students: **30**
- Students who like **pizza**: 18
- Students who like **burgers**: 12
- Students who like **both**: 6

We are to find the number of students who like **neither** pizza nor burgers, using three different approaches: **Venn diagrams**, **set theory formulas**, and **logical reasoning**.

---

### **Approach 1: Using Venn Diagrams**

We can model this using two overlapping circles representing students who like pizza and burgers.

- Students who like **only pizza**: $18 - 6 = 12$
- Students who like **only burgers**: $12 - 6 = 6$
- Students who like **both**: 6

Now, sum the students who like either pizza, burgers, or both:

$$
12 \text{ (only pizza)} + 6 \text{ (only burgers)} + 6 \text{ (both)} = 24
$$

The number of students who like **neither** is:

$$
30 - 24 = 6
$$

---

### **Approach 2: Using Set Theory Formulas**

We apply the **principle of inclusion and exclusion** for two sets:

$$
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
$$

Where:

- $|A| = 18$ (students who like pizza)
- $|B| = 12$ (students who like burgers)
- $|A \cap B| = 6$ (students who like both)

$$
|A \cup B| = 18 + 12 - 6 = 24
$$

So, the number of students who like **at least one** of the two is 24.

Therefore, the number who like **neither** is:

$$
30 - 24 = 6
$$

---

### **Approach 3: Using Logical Reasoning**

We break down the groups:

- 18 students like pizza.
- 6 of them also like burgers.
- So, only 12 students like **only** pizza.
- 12 students like burgers.
- 6 of them also like pizza.
- So, only 6 students like **only** burgers.
- 6 students like **both**.

Now, summing all these:

$$
12 \text{ (only pizza)} + 6 \text{ (only burgers)} + 6 \text{ (both)} = 24
$$

Thus, the number of students who like **neither** is:

$$
30 - 24 = 6
$$

---

### ✅ Final Confirmation

All three approaches yield the same result: **6 students** like **neither** pizza nor burgers.

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{6}
$$

# **CHAIN OF VERIFICATION**

<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Australia. Let me start by recalling what I know. From what I remember, the capital is Canberra. But I should double-check to make sure.

First, I need to confirm if Canberra is indeed the capital. I know that Sydney and Melbourne are major cities in Australia, but they are not the capital. Sydney is the largest city, right? So if the question is about the largest city, the answer would be Sydney, but the capital is different. 

Wait, the user's step 2 asks to verify by checking if the answer is the largest city and where the government is located. So, the capital should be where the government is based. Australia's federal government is based in Canberra, which is a planned city. That makes sense because sometimes countries have their capital in a different location than the largest city, like the US has Washington D.C. as the capital instead of New York.

What about other cities? Melbourne is another major city, but it's not the capital. So the confusion might come from thinking that Sydney or Melbourne is the capital, but they aren't. The key here is that Canberra is the seat of government, so that's the answer. 

I should also make sure that there's no other city that's sometimes mistaken for the capital. For example, some people might confuse Canberra with Sydney because they're both in New South Wales, but Sydney is a state capital, not the federal one. 

So putting it all together, the answer is Canberra. It's not the largest city, but it's where the government is located. The other major cities are Sydney and Melbourne, which are state capitals. Therefore, the final answer should be Canberra.
</think>

**Step 1: Initial Answer**  
The capital of Australia is **Canberra**.  

**Step 2: Verification**  
- **Largest City?** No. Sydney is the largest city in Australia.  
- **Government Location?** Yes. Canberra is the seat of the Australian federal government, housing the Parliament House, the Prime Minister's office, and key national institutions.  
- **Confusing Cities?** Sydney and Melbourne are often mistaken for the capital, but they are state capitals (New South Wales and Victoria, respectively).  

**Step 3: Final Verified Answer**  
The capital of Australia is **Canberra**. It was chosen as a compromise between Sydney and Melbourne to create a dedicated federal capital, and it serves as the political and administrative center of the country.

# **MULTI STEP REASONING**

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the initial revenue of a company given the percentage changes over three years and the final revenue. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the problem says that the company's revenue increased by 25% in Year 1, then decreased by 10% in Year 2, and then increased by 15% in Year 3. The final revenue after these three years is $1,265,000. I need to find the initial revenue before any of these changes happened.

Let me recall that when dealing with percentage changes, each year's revenue is calculated based on the previous year's revenue. So if the initial revenue is, let's say, R, then after a 25% increase in Year 1, the revenue becomes R + 25% of R, which is R * 1.25. Then in Year 2, it decreases by 10%, so that would be multiplying the previous year's revenue by 0.90. Then in Year 3, it increases by 15%, so multiplying by 1.15. The final amount after these three changes is $1,265,000.

So, if I denote the initial revenue as R, then the equation would be:

R * 1.25 * 0.90 * 1.15 = 1,265,000

My goal is to solve for R. To do this, I can work backwards from the final amount. Let me think about how to reverse each percentage change.

Starting with the final amount, which is after the third year's increase. To reverse the 15% increase, I need to divide by 1.15. Then, to reverse the 10% decrease in Year 2, I need to divide by 0.90. Finally, to reverse the 25% increase in Year 1, I need to divide by 1.25. So, working backwards, the initial revenue R would be:

R = 1,265,000 / 1.15 / 0.90 / 1.25

Let me compute that step by step. First, let me calculate the denominator first. Let me compute 1.15 * 0.90 * 1.25. Wait, actually, since we are dividing by each of those factors, the denominator is the product of 1.15, 0.90, and 1.25. So perhaps it's easier to compute the product of the three factors first, then divide the final amount by that product.

Alternatively, I can compute each step one by one. Let me try that.

Starting with the final amount: $1,265,000.

First, reverse the Year 3 increase of 15%. So, the revenue at the end of Year 2 would be:

End of Year 2 revenue = Final amount / 1.15

Let me compute that:

1,265,000 / 1.15

Hmm, 1.15 times 1,000,000 is 1,150,000. So 1,265,000 is 1,150,000 + 115,000. Let me see how many times 1.15 fits into 1,265,000.

Alternatively, maybe do the division directly. 1,265,000 divided by 1.15. Let me convert that into a fraction. Dividing by 1.15 is the same as multiplying by 100/115, which simplifies to 20/23. Let me check:

1.15 is 23/20. So dividing by 23/20 is multiplying by 20/23. So 1,265,000 * 20 / 23.

Let me compute that. First, let me divide 1,265,000 by 23, then multiply by 20.

Calculating 1,265,000 ÷ 23:

Well, 23 * 50,000 = 1,150,000

Subtract that from 1,265,000: 1,265,000 - 1,150,000 = 115,000

Now, 23 * 5,000 = 115,000

So total is 50,000 + 5,000 = 55,000

Therefore, 1,265,000 ÷ 23 = 55,000

Then multiply by 20: 55,000 * 20 = 1,100,000

Wait, so the revenue at the end of Year 2 is $1,100,000?

Wait, let me check that again because that seems like a big jump. Let me verify:

If I take $1,100,000 and increase it by 15%, that would be 1,100,000 * 1.15. Let me compute that:

1,100,000 * 1.15 = 1,100,000 + 1,100,000 * 0.15 = 1,100,000 + 165,000 = 1,265,000. Yes, that's correct. So that step checks out.

So, after reversing Year 3's increase, the end of Year 2 revenue is $1,100,000.

Now, moving to reverse the Year 2 decrease of 10%. So the revenue at the end of Year 1 would be:

End of Year 1 revenue = End of Year 2 revenue / 0.90

Which is 1,100,000 / 0.90

Let me compute that. Dividing by 0.90 is the same as multiplying by 10/9.

So 1,100,000 * 10 / 9

First, 1,100,000 * 10 = 11,000,000

Divide by 9: 11,000,000 / 9 ≈ 1,222,222.22...

Wait, let me do exact division. 9 * 1,222,222 = 9 * 1,222,222 = let's see:

Well, 1,222,222 * 9 = 11,000,000 - 1,222,222 * 9? Wait, maybe I should do it step by step.

Alternatively, 11,000,000 divided by 9. Let me compute that.

9 * 1,222,222 = 9 * 1,200,000 = 10,800,000. Then 9 * 22,222 = 199,998. So total is 10,800,000 + 199,998 = 10,999,998. Which is 11,000,000 - 2. So 11,000,000 / 9 ≈ 1,222,222.222...

So approximately $1,222,222.22. But let me check if I can write this as a fraction. Since 1,100,000 divided by 0.9 is equal to 1,100,000 / (9/10) = 1,100,000 * 10 / 9 = 11,000,000 / 9 ≈ 1,222,222.22...

So that's the end of Year 1 revenue.

Now, moving to reverse the Year 1 increase of 25%. So the initial revenue R would be:

R = End of Year 1 revenue / 1.25

Which is 11,000,000 / 9 divided by 1.25. Let me compute that.

First, 11,000,000 / 9 divided by 1.25 is equal to (11,000,000 / 9) * (1 / 1.25) = (11,000,000 / 9) * (0.8)

Alternatively, 11,000,000 / 9 * 0.8. Let me compute this.

First, 11,000,000 * 0.8 = 8,800,000

Then divide by 9: 8,800,000 / 9 ≈ 977,777.777...

So approximately $977,777.78. Wait, but let me check if there's a way to get an exact value here.

Alternatively, maybe I can combine all the steps into one formula. Let me recall that the initial revenue R is equal to Final amount divided by (1.25 * 0.90 * 1.15). Let me compute that denominator first.

Calculating 1.25 * 0.90 * 1.15.

First, multiply 1.25 and 0.90. 1.25 * 0.90 = 1.125

Then multiply by 1.15: 1.125 * 1.15

Let me compute that:

1.125 * 1.15. Let me break it down:

1.125 * 1 = 1.125

1.125 * 0.15 = 0.16875

Adding them together: 1.125 + 0.16875 = 1.29375

So the total multiplier is 1.29375

Therefore, R = 1,265,000 / 1.29375

Let me compute that division. Let me convert 1.29375 into a fraction to make division easier. 1.29375 is equal to 1 + 0.29375. Let me see:

0.29375 * 16 = 4.7, no, wait, maybe better to note that 0.29375 is 29375/100000. Let me simplify that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 5875/20000. Again by 5: 1175/4000. Again by 5: 235/800. Again by 5: 47/160. So 0.29375 = 47/160. Therefore, 1.29375 = 1 + 47/160 = 207/160.

Therefore, R = 1,265,000 divided by (207/160) = 1,265,000 * (160/207)

Let me compute that. First, simplify 1,265,000 * 160 / 207.

Let me see if 207 divides into 1,265,000 evenly. Let me check:

First, 207 * 6,000 = 207 * 6,000 = 1,242,000

Subtract that from 1,265,000: 1,265,000 - 1,242,000 = 23,000

Now, 207 * 100 = 20,700

Subtract that from 23,000: 23,000 - 20,700 = 2,300

Now, 207 * 11 = 2,277

Subtract that from 2,300: 2,300 - 2,277 = 23

So total is 6,000 + 100 + 11 = 6,111 with a remainder of 23. Therefore, 1,265,000 / 207 = 6,111 + 23/207

Therefore, R = (6,111 + 23/207) * 160

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, let me compute the decimal value of 1,265,000 divided by 1.29375.

Alternatively, note that 1.29375 is equal to 1.29375. Let me compute 1,265,000 divided by 1.29375.

First, approximate. Let me note that 1.29375 * 977,777.78 ≈ 1,265,000?

Wait, earlier when I did the step-by-step reverse calculation, I got approximately $977,777.78. Let me check that.

Let me compute 1.29375 * 977,777.78. Wait, but if R is 977,777.78, then multiplying by 1.25, 0.90, 1.15 should give 1,265,000. Let me check:

First, 977,777.78 * 1.25 = ?

Well, 977,777.78 * 1.25 = 977,777.78 * 5/4 = 977,777.78 * 1.25

Let me compute 977,777.78 * 1.25:

Multiply by 1.25 is same as multiplying by 5/4, so:

(977,777.78 * 5) / 4

Compute 977,777.78 * 5 = 4,888,888.9

Divide by 4: 4,888,888.9 / 4 = 1,222,222.225

So that's the end of Year 1 revenue, which matches the previous step. Then, multiply by 0.90 (Year 2 decrease):

1,222,222.225 * 0.90 = 1,100,000 (as checked before). Then multiply by 1.15 (Year 3 increase):

1,100,000 * 1.15 = 1,265,000. Perfect, that matches the final amount. Therefore, the initial revenue is approximately $977,777.78. But since money is usually in dollars and cents, but the problem might expect an exact value. However, given that the final amount is a whole number, maybe the initial revenue is a whole number as well? Let me check if there was a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, when I did the calculation with fractions, I had:

R = 1,265,000 * 160 / 207

Let me compute 1,265,000 * 160 first. Let me compute 1,265,000 * 160:

1,265,000 * 160 = 1,265,000 * 100 + 1,265,000 * 60 = 126,500,000 + 75,900,000 = 202,400,000

Wait, 1,265,000 * 160:

Alternatively, 1,265,000 * 160 = 1,265,000 * (1.6 * 100) = 1,265,000 * 1.6 * 100. Let me compute 1,265,000 * 1.6:

1,265,000 * 1.6 = 1,265,000 + 1,265,000 * 0.6 = 1,265,000 + 759,000 = 2,024,000

Then multiply by 100: 202,400,000. Therefore, R = 202,400,000 / 207

Now, divide 202,400,000 by 207:

First, let me check if 207 divides into 202,400,000 evenly. Let me do the division:

Divide 202,400,000 by 207.

First, note that 207 * 977,777.78 ≈ 202,400,000. But let me perform exact division.

Let me compute 207 * 977,777.78 = 202,400,000 (as above). But since 207 is 3*69, which is 3*3*23. Let me see if 207 divides into 202,400,000. Let me check.

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(202,400,000, 207). Let me compute GCD(202,400,000, 207). Since 207 factors into 3*3*23. Let me check if 202,400,000 is divisible by 3:

Sum of digits of 202,400,000: 2+0+2+4+0+0+0+0+0 = 8. 8 is not divisible by 3, so 202,400,000 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, the division will result in a decimal. Therefore, the exact value is 202,400,000 / 207 ≈ 977,777.777..., which is approximately $977,777.78 when rounded to the nearest cent. However, in some contexts, especially if the problem expects an exact value, maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check again.

Wait, earlier when I did step-by-step reverse, I got R ≈ 977,777.78. Let me check if that's the exact value. Let me note that 1.25 * 0.9 * 1.15 = 1.25 * 0.9 * 1.15 = 1.125 * 1.15 = 1.29375, as before. Therefore, R = 1,265,000 / 1.29375 = ?

Let me compute 1,265,000 / 1.29375.

Let me convert 1.29375 into a decimal multiplier. Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by 100000 to eliminate decimals:

1,265,000 * 100000 / (1.29375 * 100000) = 126,500,000,000 / 129,375.

Now, divide 126,500,000,000 by 129,375.

Let me simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: numerator becomes 126,500,000,000 /25 = 5,060,000,000; denominator becomes 129,375 /25 = 5,175.

So now, 5,060,000,000 / 5,175.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: numerator is 1,012,000,000; denominator is 1,035.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5 again: numerator is 202,400,000; denominator is 207. So we end up with 202,400,000 / 207, which is the same as before. Therefore, the exact value is 202,400,000 / 207 ≈ 977,777.777...

Since the problem didn't specify rounding, but the final amount is a whole number, maybe the initial amount is also a whole number? Let me check if 202,400,000 divided by 207 is a whole number.

Let me perform the division:

207 × 977,777 = ?

Well, 207 × 977,777 = ?

Let me compute 207 × 977,777:

First, 200 × 977,777 = 195,555,400

Then 7 × 977,777 = 6,844,439

Adding together: 195,555,400 + 6,844,439 = 202,399,839

Now, subtract this from 202,400,000: 202,400,000 - 202,399,839 = 161

Therefore, 202,400,000 ÷ 207 = 977,777 + 161/207 ≈ 977,777.777...

So the exact value is 977,777 and 161/207 dollars, which is approximately $977,777.78. Since the problem is likely expecting a clean answer, maybe I made a mistake in calculation earlier. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me check the initial steps again.

Starting with R, after multiplying by 1.25, then by 0.9, then by 1.15, gives 1,265,000.

So:

R * 1.25 * 0.9 * 1.15 = 1,265,000

Let me compute the product of the multipliers again:

1.25 * 0.9 = 1.125

1.125 * 1.15 = 1.29375, as before.

So R = 1,265,000 / 1.29375

Let me compute 1.29375 × 977,777.78 ≈ 1,265,000, which we've confirmed.

But since the problem is presented in a mathematical context, perhaps the answer is expected to be in fraction form or as a decimal. However, given that the final amount is a whole number, maybe the initial amount is also a whole number, but our calculation shows it's not. Maybe there was an error in the problem setup or my calculations?

Wait, let me check the multipliers again:

Original multipliers: 1.25 (increase by 25%), 0.9 (decrease by 10%), 1.15 (increase by 15%). So the overall factor is 1.25 * 0.9 * 1.15 = 1.25 * 0.9 = 1.125, then 1.125 * 1.15 = 1.29375, which is correct.

Therefore, the initial amount is 1,265,000 / 1.29375 = 977,777.777..., which is approximately $977,777.78. However, if the problem expects an exact value, maybe it's better to write it as a fraction: 202,400,000 / 207. Let me simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(202,400,000, 207). As before, since 207 is 3²×23, and 202,400,000 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 2+0+2+4+0+0+0+0+0 = 8), so GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in simplest terms. Therefore, the exact value is 202,400,000 / 207 ≈ 977,777.78.

But maybe there's a calculation mistake earlier? Let me check with another method. Let me compute 1,265,000 divided by 1.29375.

Let me write 1.29375 as a fraction: 1.29375 = 1 + 0.29375. 0.29375 = 29375/100000 = 23/160 (because 29375 ÷ 125 = 235; 100000 ÷ 125 = 800; 235/800 = 47/160). Wait, let me check:

0.29375 × 16 = 4.7, which is not helpful. Let me do it properly:

Multiply 0.29375 by 16: 0.29375 × 16 = 4.7, which is not helpful. Alternatively, note that 0.29375 = 29375/100000. Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 5: 5875/20000, again by 5: 1175/4000, again by 5: 235/800, again by 5: 47/160. Yes, 0.29375 = 47/160. Therefore, 1.29375 = 1 + 47/160 = 207/160. Therefore, R = 1,265,000 ÷ (207/160) = 1,265,000 × (160/207). Let me compute that:

1,265,000 × 160 = ?

First, 1,265,000 × 100 = 126,500,000

1,265,000 × 60 = 75,900,000

Total: 126,500,000 + 75,900,000 = 202,400,000

Then divide by 207: 202,400,000 / 207 ≈ 977,777.78, same as before.

Therefore, the exact value is 202,400,000 / 207, which is the same as 977,777 and 161/207 dollars. Since the problem might expect a decimal, rounding to the nearest cent, it's $977,777.78.

But let me check if there's an error in the question. For example, if the final amount was $1,293,750 instead of 1,265,000, then the calculation would be different. But given the problem states 1,265,000, I think the answer is correct.

Therefore, the initial amount is approximately $977,777.78. However, since the problem may expect an exact fractional form or a different representation, but given the context, likely decimal with cents.

But let me check once more with another approach. Let me assume the initial amount is R.

After increasing by 25%, it becomes 1.25R.

Then decreasing by 10%, it becomes 1.25R * 0.9 = 1.125R.

Then increasing by 15%, it becomes 1.125R * 1.15 = 1.29375R.

Set equal to 1,265,000:

1.29375R = 1,265,000

R = 1,265,000 / 1.29375

Convert 1.29375 to a fraction: as before, 207/160.

So R = 1,265,000 * (160/207) = (1,265,000 * 160) / 207 = 202,400,000 / 207 ≈ 977,777.78.

Yes, same result. Therefore, the answer is $977,777.78.

But let me check if there's a simpler way to compute this division. Let me divide 202,400,000 by 207:

First, divide 202,400,000 by 207:

Let me approximate 207 × 977,777 = 202,399,839 (as before), so 202,400,000 - 202,399,839 = 161. So the remainder is 161, so 202,400,000 / 207 = 977,777 + 161/207 ≈ 977,777 + 0.777... = 977,777.777...

Thus, the exact decimal is repeating, but for practical purposes, it's $977,777.78 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Therefore, the answer should be $\boxed{977777.78}$.

**Final Answer**
The initial amount is \boxed{977777.78}.
</think>

To determine the initial amount before a series of percentage changes, we analyze the sequence of transformations applied:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Sequence of Changes

Let the **initial amount** be $ R $.

- **First change**: Increase by 25% ⇒ $ R \times 1.25 $
- **Second change**: Decrease by 10% ⇒ $ R \times 1.25 \times 0.9 = R \times 1.125 $
- **Third change**: Increase by 15% ⇒ $ R \times 1.125 \times 1.15 = R \times 1.29375 $

So after all these changes, the final amount is:
$$
R \times 1.29375 = 1,265,000
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ R $

$$
R = \frac{1,265,000}{1.29375}
$$

To simplify the division, note that:
$$
1.29375 = \frac{207}{160}
$$

So:
$$
R = 1,265,000 \times \frac{160}{207} = \frac{202,400,000}{207}
$$

Now, divide:
$$
\frac{202,400,000}{207} \approx 977,777.78
$$

---

### Final Answer

The initial amount is:

$$
\boxed{977777.78}
$$
