Step 1: Calculate depreciation per year: 20,000 × 0.15 = 3000 dollars
Step 2: Total depreciation for three years: 3000 × 3 = 9000 dollars
Step 3: Calculate car value after 3 years: 20000 - 9000 = 11000 dollars
Answer: $11,000

# **SELF CONSISTENCY**

Approach 1: Using Venn diagrams

Draw a venn diagram with two circles, one representing students who like pizza (18) and the other representing students who like burgers (12). There will be an overlapping area where both conditions are true (6 students like both).

The total number of points to fill in the diagram will be 30. Fill in the first circle with 18 points, and the second circle with 12 points. The overlapping area already has 6 points filled in.

Subtract the total points that have been filled in from the overall total: 
30 - (18 + 12 - 6) = 30 - 24 = 6

This shows that there are 6 students who like neither pizza nor burgers.


Approach 2: Using set theory formulas  

Define:
- A = number of students who like pizza
- B = number of students who like burgers
- A ∩ B = number of students who like both pizza and burgers

We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the number of students who like at least one type of food:

A ∪ B = A + B - (A ∩ B)

Then, we can subtract this number from the total number of students to get the number who don't like either:

Neither = Total - (A ∪ B)
= 30 - (18 + 12 - 6)
= 30 - 24
= 6

So there are 6 students who like neither pizza nor burgers.


Approach 3: Using logical reasoning  

There are 30 students in total. 
Out of these, 18 like pizza, 12 like burgers, and 6 like both.
This means that there are already 18 + 12 - 6 = 24 students who like at least one type of food.
So the number of students who don't like either food is:
30 - 24 = 6

Therefore, using logical reasoning also gives us an answer of 6 students who like neither pizza nor burgers.

All three approaches have given us the same answer: there are 6 students in the class that like neither pizza nor burgers.

# **CHAIN OF VERIFICATION**

Step 1: Initial Answer - Sydney, Melbourne, or Brisbane could be guessed as the capital due to their size and popularity.

Step 2: Verify this answer by considering:
- Is this the largest city in Australia? No, Sydney is not the capital.
- Is this where the government is located? No, the government of Australia is situated in Canberra.
- What other major cities might be confused with the capital? The larger cities like Sydney and Melbourne could be mistaken for the capital.

Step 3: Final verified answer - The capital of Australia is Canberra. This can be confirmed through sources such as official government websites or geographical information sources, which will specify Canberra as the capital city of Australia.

# **MULTI STEP REASONING**

Step 1: We are given that the final revenue is $1,265,000. Let's denote this as F = $1,265,000. We need to find the initial revenue (I).

Step 2: Set up the equation with the revenue changes.
We have three percentage changes to consider:

- Year 1 increase of 25% on the initial revenue I
- Year 2 decrease of 10% on the result from Year 1, which can be written as a multiplication by (1 - 0.10) = 0.90
- Year 3 increase of 15% on the result from Year 2, which can be written as a multiplication by (1 + 0.15) = 1.15

So our revenue after three years will be: 
Final Revenue = I * 1.25 * 0.90 * 1.15 

Step 3: Work backwards from the final amount
Now we know that Final Revenue (F) is $1,265,000.

So:
$1,265,000 = I * 1.25 * 0.90 * 1.15

We can divide both sides by (1.25 * 0.90 * 1.15) to find I:

I = $1,265,000 / (1.25 * 0.90 * 1.15)

Step 4: Verify our answer by working forwards
Calculate I using the equation from step 2 and check if it matches with the given final revenue.

Now let's perform these calculations.
```python
# Define the constants
final_revenue = 1265000  # F = $1,265,000
year_1_increase = 1.25    # 25%
year_2_decrease = 0.90     # 10%
year_3_increase = 1.15    # 15%

# Calculate initial revenue
initial_revenue = final_revenue / (year_1_increase * year_2_decrease * year_3_increase)

# Initial Revenue Calculation:
initial_revenue
```
